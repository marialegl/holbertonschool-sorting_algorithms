The time The time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm is as follows:

Best case: O(n) - This occurs when the array is already sorted, and the algorithm only needs to make a single pass through the array to determine that it is sorted.

Average case: O(n2) - On average, the bubble sort algorithm requires nested loops to compare and swap elements.

Worst case: O(nÂ°2) - This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order, and each element needs to be moved to its correct position through multiple swaps.
